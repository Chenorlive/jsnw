                            Hon. Williams is commonly known as I’Wash amongst his childhood friends, and has withstood
                            the
                            test of time as a typical Liberian child; engaged in farming at early age and took care of
                            his
                            grandparents. Hon. Williams lived with his grandparents, up to age 19, when the civil war
                            displaced
                            the entire southeastern Liberia in 1994 for which he sought refuge in the Ivorian village of
                            Tiboto,
                            where he continued his primary education. It was during these times of hardship, challenges,
                            and
                            difficulties when he had the opportunity to meet, see and interact with his kinsmen as a
                            refugee boy.
                            Hon. Williams is a devoted Christian, Roman Catholic by faith: baptized, confirmed and
                            married and
                            blessed with five children and currently resides in one of his own properties.
