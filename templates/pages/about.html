                All of these farming activities are carried out by individual household farmers. Hence organizing these farmers into category such as smallholder farmer groups (i.e. cooperatives, unions, companies, etc.) will increase food production, improve knowledge sharing, maximize the use of scared resources, reduce cost of investment and boost economic activities.
